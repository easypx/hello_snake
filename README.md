You are a green mamba in the african savannah. Eat the apples and grow. 
Do not try to knot. This decreases your points. 
And be aware of the rivers and lakes around you. You can't swimm!
Have fun! :D

- Taken from Book: SFML Game Development by Example (PACKT Publishing)
- Fixed some Errors
- TODO: sprites, textures, levels, load/save, better state handling, titlescreen, music ...

Installation (Linux):
- Install sfml library: "sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev"

Compilation (Linux):
- Compile & run: "sh compile.sh"
- NOTE: "make" would not work! It's configured to my machine.
- Compilation on other operating systems should be similar.
